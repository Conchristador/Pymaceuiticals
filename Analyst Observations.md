Capomulin is by far and away the most effective drug and the only drug to return signifigant positive results. Capomulin led to 19% 
reduction in tumor size over 45 days of treatment, while the other two drugs plus placebo had the tumor grow by atleast 46%. 
Infubinol did mitigate tumor growth by 10% when compared to placebo while Ketapril actually resulted in more tumor growth than placebo. 
Further statistical analysis is required to say if the results for Infubinol and Ketapril are statistically signifigant especially before making the statment that Ketapril grows tumors. 

It appears that tumor size can be directly related to survival rate as Capomulin is the only drug that had above a 50% survival rate coming in at an astoanding 85% when compared to placedbo and other drugs. Metastic spread is shown in all drugs which is interesting because the total tumor size was smaller for the Capomulin samples. This may show that the spread rate was lower that the total mass reduction for the capomulin sample.
